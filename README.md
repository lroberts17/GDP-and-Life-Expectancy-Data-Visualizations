# Country Visualizations

## A project that visualizes data about GDP and life expectancy

This project will investigate relationships between data about different countries' life expectancy and GDP. The goals are to prepare data, followed by analysis with plots, and seek to explain the findings from the study. Python modules used include Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

The Jupyter Notebook file 'life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb' contains a walkthrough of the process and the Python code that performs the analysis.
